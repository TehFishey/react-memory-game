# :flower_playing_cards:  React Memory Game

This is a modified version of [Luan Eduardo da Costa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luaneducosta/)'s react-memory-game, intended for deployment by [The Final Outpost](https://finaloutpost.net/) as a holiday minigame. Changes from the original project include general versioning updates/cleanups, the addition of configurable & adjustable image displays for card components, and numerous styling changes intended to make the UI more responsive. These modifications were completed by [Michael D'Attilo](https://github.com/TehFishey) in early October 2023.

## :bulb: Deployment Information
